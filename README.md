## Motivation
This is the final project of group 25 in the course VLN2 ("Verklegt námskeið 2") in the Computer Science department of the University of Reykjavik. Our teacher is Daníel Brandur Sigurgeirsson and our assistant instructor is Bjarni Leifsson.

The name EditThor comes from Thor, the god of thunder. The name has many different connotations: it resembles the word "editor", so users shouldn't have problems understanding what it's for or remembering it. It is also derived from the Icelandic word "ritþór", which is a translation of the word "editor". Also, the group's veteran in the coding world is called Eyþór, so the name also includes a reference to him :)
